Battle Line is a card game created by Reiner Knizia. This is a web version of Battle Line. If you enjoy the game, I thoroughly recommend purchasing a copy of the original. It is a simple and rich, two-player card game.

The object of the game is to create a better three-card hand than your opponent for each Flag. If you win 5 of the 9 Flags, or 3 Flags in a row, you win the game.

Hands are ranked in the following order:

Wedge (Straight-Flush): Three-in-a-row of the same color. The best hand is 10-9-8 all of one color. This beats 9-8-7 of one color, which beats 8-7-6 of one color, etc. Any Wedge is beats a…
Phalanx (Three-of-a-Kind): Three 10s is better than three 9s, etc. Any Phalanx beats a…
Battalion Order (Flush): Three of one color (but not three-in-a-row). Sum the three numbers. Between two Flush hands, the one with the larger sum wins. Any flush beats a…
Skirmish Line (Straight): Three-in-a-row (but not of the same color). 10-9-8 beats 9-8-7, which beats 8-7-6, etc. Any straight beats…
Host (Sum): If there is no Flush, Straight or Three-of-a-Kind, sum the number values on the cards. A larger sum beats a smaller sum.

If opposing hands have the same value, the hand which was completed first wins.

There are two decks in the game.

The Troop Deck contains 60 Troop cards: 1 to 10 for each of six colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Purple.

The Tactic Deck contains 10 unique Tactic cards.

Each Tactic card has a special ability:

Darius and Alexander can represent any Troop Card. If you have already played Darius or Alexander, you cannot play the other.
Campaign Cavalry can be 8 of any color.
Shield Bearer can be 3, 2, or 1 of any color.
Fog makes a Flag based solely on largest sum.
Mud makes a Flag based on the best 4-card hand.
Traitor allows a player to take a Troop card the opponent has played, and place it on their own side next to an unclaimed flag.
Deserter allows a player to remove a Troop or Tactic card the opponent has played on an unclaimed Flag.
Redeploy allows a player to reposition a card played on an unclaimed flag to another unclaimed flag, or discard the card.
Scout allows a player to choose three cards from either Deck, and return any two cards to the top of the deck.

A player can never player two more Tactic cards than their opponent. If you have played one more Tactic card than your opponent, you must wait for your opponent to play a Tactic card before you can play another.

Each player begins with 7 Troop Cards. A Player may never have more than 7 cards in their hand at one time. On a player’s turn, they can:
1. Claim one or more Flags.
2. Play one Troop or Tactic Card.
3. Draw one Troop Card or one Tactic Card.

In this web version, a player cannot claim a Flag at the end of their turn. In the original card game, you can play either way: Claim flags at the beginning of your turn, or at the end, but not both.
